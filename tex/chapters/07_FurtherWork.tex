\section{Further work}
In this project, we have implemented a Finite Volume Method to solve the shallow water equations in 1D, succesfully simulating the dam break problem.
Although we attempted to extend this method to 2D, time constraints prevented us from completing it.
We also began adapting the 1D method to accommodate a curved bottom surface instead of a flat one but couldn't finish this implementation either.
Both extensions are promising, and it would be interesting to observe how the model performs with a curved bottom.
Another interesting extension is to implement the FVM in 3D and use it to solve the SWE in spherical coordinates.
