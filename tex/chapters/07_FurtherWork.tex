\section{Further work}
%Future work could explore hybrid methods, to combine the strengths of both numerical and data-driven methods, and adress their limitations.

%Another interesting extension is to implement the FVM to solve the SWE in spherical coordinates, on a planet scale.
%Use the numerical method to generate data for training the data-driven models.
%The literature suggests good results for the spherical Fourier neural operator (SFNO) in forecasting.
