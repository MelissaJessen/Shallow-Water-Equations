\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How good are the data-driven methods compared to the classic numerical methods, in this case the FVM?
    \item Shorter computation time = sustainability
    \item Advantages/disadvantages numerical / data-driven methods - compare with the literature 
    For the numerical methods we can often estimate the error. IS that possible using data-driven methods?
    \item The data-driven methods could possibly perform better if trained on more data and for more epochs. 
    \item Has somehow shown potential for what the data-driven methods can do? Supplement to numerical methods, depending on the application.
    \item The data-driven methods are not as transparent as the numerical methods. Or accurate.
    \item The data-driven methods are not as general as the numerical methods.
    \item Truncation errors. Generating data fron the FVM, how much accuracy do we lose?
    \item Perspectivations to the literature.
\end{itemize}
