\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
This concludes the study on exploring to which extent data-driven models can be a valuable addition to, or even a replacement of, already existing numerical methods.
The focus has been on solving the SWE, which model water dynamics in areas like coastal regions, using the FVM and data-driven methods such as CNNs and FNOs.

In this thesis, we have derived the shallow water equations, and explored the underlying theory and assumptions behind the equations.
We have researched and implemented the FVM for solving the SWE in 1D and 2D, and validated the implementation against known test cases.
We extended the FVM approach to solve the 1D LSWE on a sphere, employing the ERK4 time-stepping method to obtain high-accuracy solutions.
The FVM proved to be a reliable method for solving the SWE, offering high accuracy.

We have also investigated data-driven approaches, specifically CNNs and FNOs, to evalutate their potential as more efficient alternatives to the FVM.
Both models were trained to solve the SWE in 1D and 2D scenarios, using the data generated by the FVM.
For the 1D case, both models performed well, with the CNN achieving a lower overall error and shorter training time.
When tested with new initial conditions, the FNO maintained accuracy compared to the original training data, while the CNN experienced a slight drop in precision.
For the 1D LSWE on a sphere, both models again yielded good results, with the CNN outperforming the FNO in terms of accuracy and training time.
However, for the steepest initial condition, the accuracy of the two models was nearly identical.
In terms of run time for the 1D cases, the FVM was the fastest method, completing simularions significantly faster than both the data-driven models.

In the 2D case, the FNO demonstrated higher accuracy than the CNN, but the CNN was significantly faster.
When evaluating grid transferability, both models maintained accuracy in transitioning solutions from a coarse grid to a fine grid.
However, the FNO outperformed the CNN in terms of the MSE and the MAE.
When analysing run times, we found that for smaller grid sizes, the FVM is the fastest method.
Yet, for larger grids, where the FVM becomes computationally expensive, data-driven methods are more efficient.
Leveraging grid transferability, these models are much faster than the FVM while maintaining accuracy.
The CNN model is over 60 times faster, and the FNO model is over 7 times faster, including training time.
Besides, the data-driven methods have the clear advantage that they only need to be trained once.
Once trained, they can also predict efficiently for new initial conditions, addressing scalability issues in solving the SWE numerically.

Regarding long-term predictions, both models produced good results within the first time steps, but as time progressed, the error increased for the CNN model.
The FNO model maintained accuracy for longer time horizons, demonstrating its potential for long-term predictions, an outcome that aligns well with the literature.

The choice of method ultimately depends on the application.
For scenarios requiring precise simulations and where time is not a critical factor, numerical methods remain the most accurate and reliable option.
However, its computational expence and reliance on fine grid resolutions make it less suitable for rapid simulations, such as real-time flood forecasting.
Conversely, data-driven methods have proven highly effective for fast simulations, meeting the growing demand for computationally efficient models across various fields.
Among these, the FNO model has demonstrated particular promise for grid transferability and long-term predictions, making it a practical alternative to the FVM when speed is a priority and accuracy can be slightly compromised.
This is especially valuable in emergency situations, where rapid predictions are crucial for decision-making.

This study highlights the potential of training and saving data-driven models.
Once trained, these models can quickly generate predictions for new initial conditions and grid sizes, offering a flexible and efficient approach to simulation.
Additionally, they can aid in generating more data to a better understanding of water dynamics, ultimately leading to new knowledge and insights.
A natural extension of this work could be to explore hybrid methods that combine the strengths of both numerical and data-driven approaches, offering a more comprehensive and efficient solution to SWE.
This approach could help overcome the limitations of each method, and provide more robust solutions for real-world applications.
Another interesting extension is to implement the FVM to solve the SWE in spherical coordinates on a planetary scale.
This could be used to generate data for training data-driven models.
The literature suggests promising results for the spherical Fourier neural operator (SFNO) in forecasting applications.

In a world facing an increasing frequency of extreme weather events, the need for rapid and accurate simulations is more important than ever.
The integration of data-driven methods with numerical techniques could play a vital role in addressing these challenges, ensuring better preparedness and response to natural disasters.
