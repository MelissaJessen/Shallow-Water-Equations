\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}


\begin{itemize}
    \item By training the FNO on a coarse grid and evalue on a fine grid, the run time is XX times faster, while maintaining the same accuracy.
    \item Long-term prediction: the FNO can predict the solution for a longer time than the training time. However, I do not have good results for training on coarse grid, predicting for a fine grid for long-term prediction.
\end{itemize}



FNO's ability to generalize to unseen data.
