\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\textbf{Acknowledgements}}
First, I would like to thank my supervisor, Allan, for his guidance throughout this project.
For having many great ideas, providing valuable feedback and meeting me with trust and encouragement.
And for always being ready for a chat about hiking or running.

Througout the last five months, I have had the pleasure of spending a lot of time at the DTU library with a great group of people.
A special shoutout to my loyal bib gang, Hannah and Aleksander, who made the long days at the library way more enjoyable.
Sharing ups and downs over a cup of coffee or a walk around campus has meant a lot to me.

Thanks to my friends and family for their support during this process.
Your belief in me has been a great source of motivation.
Last, but not least, I want to thank my better half, Matteo, for endless support and comfort.
Having you by my side makes everything better.

This thesis also marks the end of my 5.5 years at DTU, filled with academic challenges, personal growth and a lot of fun.
I am truly grateful for all the people I have met and the friends I have made along the way.
Looking ahead, I am excited to see what comes next.
