    This master thesis focuses on the numerical and data-driven solutions for the Shallow Water Equations (SWE), which are fundamental in computational fluid dynamics. The project aims to solve the SWE using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) in 2D and spherical coordinates and subsequently exploit machine learning techniques, particularly the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), to improve solution accuracy and efficiency. By the end of the project, the goal is to have a robust and efficient computational toolkit for solving the SWE, which will also be useful for simulating important geophysical processes like Kelvin and Rossby waves.
